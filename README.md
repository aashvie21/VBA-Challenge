# VBA Challenge Analysis
## Purpose of the analysis
In the excel worksheet “VBA Challenge” we have 12 ticker symbols for 2 years that is “2017” and “2018”. The purpose of this analysis is to get the total daily volume for each ticker symbol and total returns on each of those ticker symbols. With the help of tools such as For, I was able to create a loop in order to get the total volume of ticker symbols. Secondly, with the help of Arrays I was able to get the results (daily volume and returns) for the rest of the ticker symbols.

## Results
In order to compare the stock performance of 2017 and 2018 there are 2 different tables for “Ticker”, “Daily volume” and “Returns”. 
## 2017
In the year 2017 we can see that there are 12ticker symbols that are in the sheet. As we can see 80% of them has negative returns however only two of them have positive returns and are making profits. The following ticker symbols which are making profits are as follows
•	ENPH
•	RUN
Symbol which is making the maximum profit is “RUN” with 84% returns with “ENPH” making 81.9% returns. Ticker symbol which has performed the lowest is “DQ” which has backed 12th position 

## 2018
In the year 2018 we can see that there are 12 ticker symbols that are in the sheet. As we can see that 80% of them has positive returns however, only two of them have negative returns and making losses. The following ticker symbols which are making losses are as follows
•	AY
•	TERP
Symbol which is incurring the maximum loss is “TERP” with -7.2% return. Ticker symbol which has performed the best is “DQ” with 199.4% returns.
